> > âŒ™ðŸ“„ BGMmanager.cs
> > > Because the operation characteristics are different from SoundManager, the code was written separately. It doesn't matter if the sound output from SoundManager is cut off when the scene changes, but the background sound output from BGMmanager must remain alive even when the scene changes, so the code was written separately because of its different properties.

Through the previously declared function, you can set whether to activate or deactivate the drag function, whether it is in the current dragging state or when the mouse is released. By default, the drag function is activated.

  - Note

1. When using the VoiceManager prefab

     - You can set the prefab by dragging it to the scene you want to use, and adjust the desired voice pitch, speaking rate, and text in the inspector window of the VoiceManager object.
     - After setting in the inspector window, use playVoice in the desired script code (id or name -> At this time, id can be considered the index of the settings list set in the inspector window)

2. Comment processing in FixedStartScene script

     - When building, be sure to uncomment and build.

3. When using the BackgroundCanvas prefab

     - Set the prefab by dragging it to the scene you want to use, set the Render Camera in the canvas component window of the inspector window by dragging the Main Camera of the scene, and drag the background image you want to use using the sprite value of the applied ImgSizeResize script. You must set it. (The same applies when using the JackBackgroundCanvas prefab.)
