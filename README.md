# Children in Forest🎄
--------------
## Project Purpose
> The purpose is to develop a game app for children. Since the main consumer base is children, a cute and fairy-tale atmosphere was created to suit their emotions, and it was produced on the Android platform. However, there are also some negative views about children's frequent use of smartphones, which are said to cause language, emotional, and social development disorders. We recognized this problem and enabled children to grow linguistically and mentally through this app, which is not just for entertainment purposes, but also combines common sense and language education for children's proper growth with games.

> **1. Cavity removal game**
>
> This game aims to remind children that if they do not brush their teeth while trying to remove cavities, the cavities that appear in the game will occur. The screen composition shows the child and his or her teeth. At this time, cavities develop in the teeth, and this is a game where you simply click to get rid of them. The game ends when a certain number of cavity bacteria are eliminated. As content to be added in the future, when the number of cavity bacteria increases to a certain number, the game is over and the child is shown what happens if he or she does not brush his or her teeth.

>**2. Puzzle Game**
>
> It is a simple puzzle game to improve children’s spatial awareness. For the screen composition, a familiar puzzle game was created using dinosaurs, children's favorite IP. It consists of 9 puzzle pieces, and is a game where you drag the randomly placed puzzle pieces on the right and fit them onto the puzzle board on the left. When you complete the puzzle, the game ends. In the future, we plan to increase the types of puzzles so that when a puzzle is solved, if it is a dinosaur, the name of the dinosaur will be spoken in Korean or the name of the dinosaur in English to remind the child of the puzzle.

Using tts, the names of the fruits were told to the child verbally so that the child could associate the names of the fruits.
